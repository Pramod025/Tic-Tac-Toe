## Description

This project is a Tic-Tac-Toe game written in C++. It allows two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid. The game ends when one player wins by forming a line of three of their symbols (either 'x' or 'o') horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or when the grid is full, resulting in a draw.
